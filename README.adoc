## GCP Deployment

This repository provides an automated deployment of a Docker Compose environment hosting a sample PHP application for ICAI Sporting Items on a MySQL database. The deployment is managed using Terraform, which provisions a virtual machine instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and installs Docker and Docker Compose via an initialization script.

## Prerequisites

Before running the deployment, ensure you have the following:

1. [Download the GCP project credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) and save the resulting JSON file as `../gcp-identity.json` (one directory above this repository).
2. In each example directory, set the variables `gcp-username` and `gcp-project` with the appropriate values.
3. Install Terraform on your local machine.
4. Ensure you have appropriate IAM permissions to create instances in GCP.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the infrastructure, navigate to the repository directory and run the following commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After a short period, the assigned IP addresses of the provisioned virtual machines will be displayed.

## Post-Deployment Configuration

Once the deployment is complete, allow a few minutes for package downloads and the configuration of the MySQL database and PHP application.

### Database Access

- **Database System:** MySQL
- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** `secret`

## Notes

- The provided credentials should be changed for security purposes.
- Modify the Terraform script to customize the infrastructure to your specific needs.
